# Query:
What is gprMax?

# Answer:
gprMax is an open source software that simulates electromagnetic wave propagation. It solves Maxwell's equations in 3D using the Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) method. While it was designed primarily for modeling Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR), it can also be used for various other applications involving electromagnetic wave propagation. gprMax is written in Python with performance-critical components in Cython and supports both CPU and GPU-based solvers.
